Recursion - a function which calls itself

```
Recursion is a method to solve problems. It means breaking down a problem into 
smaller and smaller sub-problems until the sub-problem is easy to solve. 
Recursive functions call themselves. Often, recursive solutions are terse and elegant. 
Recursive solutions are not always the most efficient. However, they can be an excellent 
starting point that you can improve the efficiency of afterward.
